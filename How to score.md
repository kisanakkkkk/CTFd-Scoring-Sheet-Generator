# How to Score?

1. Check each user/team POC, see if the answer is logical, clear, and whether there are indications of cheating or not.
2. Go to sheets for each category (Web, Binex, etc.), then fill the column with these values:
    - `OK` if the flag is correct and the poc writeup is clear ({chall_score} * 1)
    - `D` if there's a point deduction (e.g. due to unclear writeup). The user's point for that chall will be deducted by half. ({chall_score} * 0.5)
    - `X` if the chall is not solved or not included in the writeup. ({chall_score} * 0)
    - `P` for Pending, if the poc is unclear and need further clarification ({chall_score} * 0)

    <br>**Scores will be auto-generated.**

3. After completing the Category sheets, proceed to the Accumulation Sheet. The final score for each player will be displayed to assist you in viewing the final scoreboard after checking and deductions.
